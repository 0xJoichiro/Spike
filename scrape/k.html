    <p>Wrong precision when adding balance within the <code>restoreBridgeTransaction</code> function, leading to loss of assets.</p>
    <h2 id="vulnerability-detail">Vulnerability Detail</h2>
    <p>In Line 90 below, the <code>AccountStorage.layout().balances</code> stores the account's balance in 18 precision, while the <code>bridgeTransaction.amount</code> stores the amount of token to be bridged in token native precision (e.g., USDC = 6 decimals).</p>

    <p>Assume that the number of tokens to bridge is 10000 USDC (10000e6). Thus, <code>bridgeTransaction.amount</code> will be set to 10000e6. The protocol detects an anomaly with the bridging transaction and suspends it. After reviewing the transaction, the protocol decides to deduct 50% of the total bridged amount (5000 USDC).</p>
    <p>The protocol executes <code>restoreBridgeTransaction</code> function with <code>validAmount</code> parameter set to 5000 USDC (1e6). The balance of "invalidBridgedAmountsPool" account will be incremented by 5000e6, as shown below. This is incorrect because the account balance in the protocol is denominated in 18 decimal precision. Over here, the code fails to convert the native token precision to the protocol's native precision (18) before assigning it to the account balance.</p>
    <pre><code class="solidity language-solidity">AccountStorage.layout().balances[bridgeLayout.invalidBridgedAmountsPool] += (bridgeTransaction.amount - validAmount);
    AccountStorage.layout().balances[bridgeLayout.invalidBridgedAmountsPool] += 10000e6 - 5000e6
    AccountStorage.layout().balances[bridgeLayout.invalidBridgedAmountsPool] += 5000e6</code></pre>
    <p>When the protocol attempts to withdraw the assets from the "invalidBridgedAmountsPool" account, the <code>accountLayout.balances[msg.sender]</code> will be 5000e6, and thus, the maximum value of <code>amountWith18Decimals</code> will be 5000e6. If <code>amountWith18Decimals</code> is 5000e6, the maximum <code>amount</code> that can be withdrawn will be 0.000000000000005 USDC based on the following formula. </p>
    <p>The protocol should have received 5000 USDC, but due to a precision error, it could only receive a maximum of 0.000000000000005 USDC, resulting in a loss of assets.</p>
    <pre><code class="solidity language-solidity">amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) / (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());

    <p>Each PartyA's account has a liquidation fee (LF) component, which is reserved and locked.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Refer to explanation of Liquidation Fee (LF) at <a href="https://github.com/SYMM-IO/protocol-core?tab=readme-ov-file#sendquote">https://github.com/SYMM-IO/protocol-core?tab=readme-ov-file#sendquote</a></li>
    <li>Refer to the diagram at <a href="https://github.com/SYMM-IO/protocol-core?tab=readme-ov-file#liquidate-party-a">https://github.com/SYMM-IO/protocol-core?tab=readme-ov-file#liquidate-party-a</a> where the blue section refer to the locked Liquidation Fee of a PartyA's account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The PartyA's locked liquidation fee (LF) is the prize that will be paid to the liquidator. In my scenario, the locked LF of Bob's PartyA account is \$100. Thus, any liquidator that liquidates Bob's PartyA is entitled to a maximum of $100, as per the protocol's specification. This liquidator fee was agreed upon by both the PartyA (maker) and PartyB (taker) when they opened the position and finalized within the protocol.</p>
    <p>The protocol specification already clearly dictates that any liquidator who liquidates Bob's PartyA is entitled to a maximum of \$100, which is PartyA's locked liquidation fee (LF). However, in the scenario mentioned in the report, the liquidator (Alice) received \$900 instead of \$100, which deviates from the protocol specification.</p>
    <p>The liquidator (Alice) took more than what was expected from Bob's account. When a liquidator liquidates Bob's account, they are not entitled to all the assets left in the account. They are only entitled to \$100 and not anything more than that.</p>
    <p><strong>WangSecurity</strong></p>
    <p>Thank you for that clarification, but there's still one part I might be missing. In your scenario, <strong>after</strong> Alice liquidates Bob (PartyA), and <strong>before</strong> she receives these $100 of LF, Bob also gets $1000. Is it because he liquidated the previous PartyA or other users?</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/WangSecurity">@WangSecurity</a> </p>
    <p>Firstly, the term "PartyA" is the same as "User/Other Users". Users are normal people who trade on Symm platform and anyone with a blockchain wallet can do so (permissionless).</p>
    <p>Secondly, Alice did not receive $100 in my scenario. Instead, she receives $900, which is incorrect and much more than expected. This amount exceeds the maximum allowed liquidation fee of $100 she is entitled. Effectively, $800 is "stolen" from Bob and Bob lost $800.</p>
    <p>Following are the timeline of the events for reference:</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>WangSecurity</strong></p>
    <p>Thank you, but I'm not sure if it answers my question. </p>
    <p>In T3, it says "Some liquidations have settled and Bob receives 1000 as a liquidation fee". It's Bob liquidating other users correct? Just need to clarify where these funds come from.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>At T1, Bob (Liquidator) kick-off the liquidation process against other users (e.g., James and Jack). James has 500 locked as LF, and Jack also has 500 locked as LF.</li>
    <li>At T3, the liquidations have settled, and the locked LF of James and Jack, which totals 1000, will be transferred to Bob. In short, the funds come from James and Jack, which Bob gains as compensation for the service he has provided in liquidating them.</li>

    <p>Deferred Liquidation can get stuck at step one of the liquidation process if the nonce increments, leading to a loss of assets.</p>
    <h2 id="vulnerability-detail-3">Vulnerability Detail</h2>
    <p>Assume the following:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>At T10, PartyA becomes liquidatable due to price movement, resulting in a drop in PnL</li>
    <li>At T20, PartyA is solvent again. This can be due to various reasons, such as users allocating more funds or the prices recovering. Note that in the new version of the protocol, allocating funds does not lead to an increase in the account's nonce.</li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[!NOTE]</p>
      <p>Per the <a href="https://naveed1.notion.site/Symmio-changes-in-version-0-8-3-0dc891da26fc4706a59ba7295a26dfbd">documentation</a>, the purpose of deferred liquidation is to allow the liquidator to liquidate the user who was liquidated at a certain block (it can be the current block or a block in the past). Even if PartyA is solvent in the current block, the account can still be liquidated if it has been eligible for liquidation in the past. The excess collateral in the accounts will returned back to the users.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ol start="3">
    <li><p>Still at T20. A liquidator (Bob) is aware that PartyA is liquidatable at T10. Thus, he requests the deferred liquidation signature from Muon. At T10, PartyA's nonce is equal to 555. The <code>liquidationId</code>, <code>liquidationTimestamp</code>, <code>partyANonces</code> of the signature will be 100, T10, and 555, respectively. He proceeds to call the <code>deferredLiquidatePartyA</code> function with the signature, and the <code>liquidationId</code> of 100 is locked in the system. PartyA's liquidation status is set to true, and the account is technically "frozen".</p></li>
    <li><p>At T21, one of the PartyBs that PartyA trades with triggers the <code>chargeFundingRate</code> function against the PartyA to charge a funding rate (non-malicious event), or it can also be executed intentionally with malicious intention. Note that one PartyA can trade with multiple PartyBs. The function will check if PartyA is solvent, and the <a href="https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-symmetrical-update-2/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/FundingRate/FundingRateFacetImpl.sol#L73">solvency check</a> will pass because PartyA is solvent at this point (T21). At the <a href="https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-symmetrical-update-2/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/FundingRate/FundingRateFacetImpl.sol#L76">end of the function</a>, PartyA's nonce will increment to 556.</p></li>
    <li><p>The liquidator's <a href="https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-symmetrical-update-2/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/DeferredLiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L62">deferredSetSymbolsPrice</a> transaction gets executed at T22. It is normal to have a slight delay due to many reasons, such as network congestion, low gas, or some preparation needed. Since the PartyA's nonce on the liquidation signature (555) is different from the current PartyA's nonce (556), the liquidation signature (liquidationId=100) will no longer be considered valid, and it cannot be used to proceed with the second step (set symbol price) of the liquidation process. The signature check is performed <a href="https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-symmetrical-update-2/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/DeferredLiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L66">here</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p>If the liquidator attempts to fetch the liquidation signature for T10 from Muon again, PartyA's nonce of the signature will always remain at 555 because this is PartyA's nonce value at T10.</p></li>
    <li><p>As a result, liquidation for PartyA will be struck.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="impact-3">Impact</h2>
    <p>Loss of assets for the counterparty as the transfer of the assets from a liquidatable account to the counterparty cannot be made. The liquidation process cannot be completed as the liquidatable account is stuck.</p>
    <p>In addition, since the liquidatable account is stuck, the assets under the accounts are also locked.</p>

    <p>Manual Review</p>
    <h2 id="recommendation-3">Recommendation</h2>
    <p>After step one of the deferred liquidation process, Party A's nonce should not change under any circumstance. Otherwise, the liquidation will be stuck.</p>
    <p>Upon review of the codebase, it was found that only the <code>chargeFundingRate</code> function can update PartyA's nonce after step one of the deferred liquidation process. Thus, consider adding the <code>notLiquidatedPartyA</code> modifier to the <code>chargeFundingRate</code> function to prevent anyone from charging the funding rate against a PartyA account already marked as liquidated to mitigate this issue.</p>
    <pre><code class="diff language-diff">    function chargeFundingRate(

    <p>This issue should be at least a Medium Risk due to its significant impact (Loss of assets) if the risk is realized.</p>
    <p>The report has demonstrated how it could lead to asset loss or stuck under normal conditions. The liquidation process is divided into multiple stages/steps as follows:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Stage 1 - <code>deferredLiquidatePartyA</code></li>
    <li>Stage 2 - <code>deferredSetSymbolsPrice</code></li>
    <li>Stage 3 - <code>liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA</code></li>
    <li>Stage 4 - <code>liquidatePositionsPartyA</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is no requirement for the liquidator to complete all the stages in one go within a single block, and this requirement is also not being enforced within the smart contracts. As such, liquidators have the option to execute each of the above stages in a single or multiple blocks as they see fit.</p>
    <p>Thus, it is a valid scenario where Stage 2 of the liquidation process is executed on a different block from Stage 1 of the liquidation process, resulting in the issue highlighted in this report to occur.</p>

        <p>V. How to identify a medium issue:<br>
        Causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states, or a loss is highly constrained. The losses must exceed small, finite amount of funds, and any amount relevant based on the precision or significance of the loss.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Whenever the liquidator does not execute Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the liquidation process within a single block, the issue mentioned in this report can occur, causing the user’s asset to be stuck. Thus, it meets Sherlock's requirement of a Medium Risk, where it causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states.</p>

    <p>I need some clarification on how the loss of funds occurs, if the PartyA was liquidatable at T10, but is not liquidatable at T20, what is the loss of funds here exactly? Maybe a numeric example would be perfect here <a href="https://github.com/xiaoming9090">@xiaoming9090</a>  </p>
    <p>Additionally, are PartyB and PartyA roles or contracts and as I understand they’re considered Trusted?</p>

    <p>Question: <code>how the loss of funds occurs</code><br>
    Answer: When this issue is realized, the liquidation process will be stuck, and the account will be frozen. No one (users or liquidators) can retrieve the assets in the "frozen" account. Thus, all assets within the frozen account are effectively lost. If the "frozen" account has $10000 worth of assets, this amount will be lost.</p>
    <p>Question: <code>if the PartyA was liquidatable at T10, but is not liquidatable at T20</code><br>
    Answer: To simplify, it is a special new feature of Symm IO that allows a liquidator to "go back in time". Assume Bob's account becomes liquidatable for a moment due to volatile market movement (e.g., at T10). The price movement goes down and then up within a short period of time. Thus, when the liquidators detect it at T20, the account might be solvent again since the price has recovered. However, that does not matter for the liquidator because they are allowed to liquidate Bob's account based on old historical data at T10.</p>
    <p>Question: <code>PartyB and PartyA roles or contracts and as I understand they’re considered Trusted?</code></p>
    <ul>
    <li>PartyA is permissionless, and anyone can become a PartyA. Thus, it is considered as Untrusted.</li>
    <li>PartyB has to be whitelisted by the protocol. However, in my report's scenario, PartyB does not need to behavior maliciously. Thus, it does not matter whether PartyB is trusted or not. PartyBs will periodically charge funding rates on PartyAs, which is a normal operation and non-malicious event. When the <code>chargeFundingRate</code> function is triggered at T21, the issue will be realized.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>WangSecurity</strong></p>
    <p>Thank you very much! And another question on the scenario, if we change it a bit to the following:</p>
    <ol start="3">
    <li>At T20, PartyB calls <code>chargeFundingRate</code>, changing the Nonce to 556.</li>
    <li>At 21, Bob (liquidator) will request the deferred liquidation signature from Muon. But the signature will return the nonce of 555, correct?</li>
    </ol>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/WangSecurity">@WangSecurity</a> </p>
    <p>Firstly, a PartyA can interact with many PartyBs within the system. At any point, each PartyB can call the <code>chargeFundingRate</code> function.</p>
    <p>Secondly, the steps in the POC should not be swapped. The timing and sequence of each step are important for the edge case to be triggered. The report presents an edge case that will happen when the <code>chargeFundingRate</code> function is triggered after the <code>deferredLiquidatePartyA</code> function, not the other way around. </p>
    <p>On a side note, the sponsor has accepted the technical aspect of the POC, so there is no doubt about its correctness and the possibility of this edge case occurring. Otherwise, a <a href="https://github.com/SYMM-IO/protocol-core/pull/50">fix</a> would not be required if the edge case cannot occur.</p>
    <p>The reason why this has been wrongly judged as Low in the first place is due to the following comments:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Low/Med, Watson assumes Deferred liquidation can get stuck because of nonce increment via network congestion, low gas or some additional preparation which is unrealistic to occur as most of the liquidation is done in a single block still there is room for this to occur. Probability of this happening is low</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, in Sherlock, issues are not judged based on the probability that an issue can happen.</p>
    <p><strong>WangSecurity</strong></p>
    <p>Thank you, I agree that even though this case might be highly unlikely, it's viable and should be deemed valid. Planning to accept the escalation and validate the report with medium severity, since the constraints for this scenario are quite high.</p>
    <p>And <a href="https://github.com/xiaoming9090">@xiaoming9090</a> just for your info, the comment from a judge you quoted is not from the Lead Judge, but from another Judge from the contest. That doesn't affect anything, just making sure you're aware of that.</p>

    <h2 id="vulnerability-detail-4">Vulnerability Detail</h2>
    <p>The <code>allocate</code> and <code>depositAndAllocate</code> functions are guarded by the <code>whenNotAccountingPaused</code> modifier to ensure that collateral can only be allocated when the accounting is not paused.</p>

    <p>However, malicious users can bypass this restriction by exploiting the newly implemented <code>AccountFacet.internalTransfer</code> function. When the global pause (<code>globalPaused</code>) and accounting pause (<code>accountingPaused</code>) are enabled, malicious users can use the <code>AccountFacet.internalTransfer</code> function, which is not guarded by the <code>whenNotAccountingPaused</code> modifier, to continue allocating collateral to their accounts, effectively bypassing the pause.</p>

    <h2 id="impact-4">Impact</h2>
    <p>When the global pause (<code>globalPaused</code>) and accounting pause (<code>accountingPaused</code>) are enabled, this might indicate that:</p>
    <p>1) There is an issue, error, or bug in certain areas (e.g., accounting) of the system. Thus, the funds transfer should be halted to prevent further errors from accumulating and to prevent users from suffering further losses due to this issue<br>
    2) There is an ongoing attack in which the attack path involves transferring/allocating funds to an account. Thus, the global pause (<code>globalPaused</code>) and accounting pause (<code>accountingPaused</code>) have been activated to stop the attack. However, it does not work as intended, and the hackers can continue to exploit the system by leveraging the new internal transfer function to workaround the restriction.</p>
    <p>In both scenarios, this could lead to a loss of assets.</p>
